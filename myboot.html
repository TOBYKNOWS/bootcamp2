        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the world, influencing industries from healthcare to finance. AI enables machines to learn, reason, and act like humans, improving efficiency and decision-making across a variety of fields. This article discusses the history, types, applications, challenges, and future of AI.</p>

        <h2>History of AI</h2>
        <p>AI's journey began in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was first coined. Early AI research involved symbolic systems designed to simulate human reasoning. Since then, AI has evolved dramatically, with machine learning and deep learning algorithms paving the way for modern developments.</p>

        <h2>Types of AI</h2>
        <p>AI is categorized into three main types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI):</strong> ANI is designed to perform specific tasks, like facial recognition or voice assistants. It is the most common form of AI today.</li>
            <li><strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):</strong> AGI refers to a machine with cognitive abilities similar to a human, able to perform any task. AGI remains a theoretical concept.</li>
            <li><strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):</strong> ASI surpasses human intelligence and could lead to unprecedented technological advancements. However, it raises ethical concerns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of AI</h2>
        <p>AI is used in a wide variety of fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> AI assists in diagnosing diseases, developing personalized treatments, and improving patient care.</li>
            <li><strong>Finance:</strong> AI algorithms help with fraud detection, risk management, and automated trading.</li>
            <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles:</strong> AI powers self-driving cars, enhancing road safety and reducing traffic accidents.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Service:</strong> AI chatbots streamline customer service interactions by answering common queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> AI personalizes recommendations on streaming platforms, like Netflix and Spotify.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges of AI</h2>
        <p>Despite its many advantages, AI also presents challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bias:</strong> AI systems can unintentionally perpetuate biases found in the data they are trained on.</li>
            <li><strong>Job Loss:</strong> As AI automation increases, there is concern about job displacement in industries like manufacturing and customer service.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> AI relies on large amounts of data, raising questions about how personal information is collected and used.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future of AI</h2>
        <p>The future of AI is promising but uncertain. Advances in deep learning, neural networks, and quantum computing could push AI beyond current limitations. However, ethical considerations, including data privacy and safety, must be addressed.
